# Introduction

This Python Jupyterbook has been created based on the tutorials of the course 14.388 "Inference on Causal and Structural Parameters Using ML and AI" in the Department of Economics at MIT taught by Professor Victor Chernozukhov. All the notebooks were in R and we decided to translate them into [Python](https://d2cml-ai.github.io/14.388_py/), and [Julia](https://d2cml-ai.github.io/14.388_jl/).
