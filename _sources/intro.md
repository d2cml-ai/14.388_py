# Introduction

This Jupyterbook has been created based on the tutorials of the course 14.388 Inference on Causal and Structural Parameters Using ML and AI in the Department of Economics at MIT taught by Professor Victor Chernozukhov. All the scripts were in R and we decided to translate them into Python, so students can manage both programing languages. Jannis Kueck and V. Chernozukhov have also published the original R Codes in Kaggle. In adition, we included tutorials on Heterogenous Treatment Effects Using Causal Trees and Causal Forest from Susan Athey’s Machine Learning and Causal Inference course. We aim to add more empirical examples were the ML and CI tools can be applied using both programming languages.
